When you want to access DOM elements in javascript you'd do something like this:

document.querySelector('img').clientHeight

But you can't do that in React.

When you want to access DOM elements directly in React you do not make use of any of the normal dom accessing methods (querySelector, getElementById) etc.

Instead you make use of the react system called "refs":

  - refs gives access to a single DOM element
  - you create refs in the constructor of a class or use the useRef hook and assign it to instance vars, then pass that to a particular JSX element as props.
  - the ref itself is a javascript object that has a "current" property. The current property references a DOM node. In the example above it would reference the img element
