window.location is an object that's built into your browser. This object is automatically updated when you navigate to a different url. The object has a lot of info extracted from the current url.

Inside the object there's a property named 'pathname'. The pathname is everything inside the url after the domain.

  https://localhost:3000/translate

Here the pathname is '/translate'. If we were at the home or root of the url, the pathname would be '/'

Route mappings:

window.location.pathname === '/' -> show Accordion component
window.location.pathname === '/list' -> show Search component
window.location.pathname === '/dropdown' -> show Dropdown component
window.location.pathname === '/translate' -> show Translate component

You define a series of different functions. In each of these functions you do one of these different comparisons. If this comparison is true, we will return the appropriate component.
